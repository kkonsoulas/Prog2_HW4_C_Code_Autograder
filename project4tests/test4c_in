The GREAT red hills stand desolate, and the earth has TORN away like flesh. 
The lightning flashes over them, the CLOUDS pour down upon them, the dead streams 
come to life, FULL of the red blood of the earth. Down in the valleys 
women scratch the soil that is left, and the maize hardly reaches 
the height of a man.
